           <h2>How internet works</h2>
           <p> the internet is a global communication system for trasmitting data across different type of media
           <br>
           and it can be described as a global networds that connects different networds, wether privet , public, commerical , acadimic or government networds by means of wireless of fibre-optic technologies

        <h2>Internet Protocols</h2>
        <p> The Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of requirements for addressing and routing data on the Internet. IP can be used with several transport protocols, including TCP and UDP.
        <br>
        The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called packets. IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps routers to send packets to the right place. Every device or domain that connects to the Internet is assigned an IP address, and as packets are directed to the IP address attached to them, data arrives where it is needed.

        <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
        <p> An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.
        <br>
        In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network: they contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.

            <h2>DNS</h2>
                <p> (Domain Name System) The Internet's system for converting alphabetic names into numeric IP addresses. For example, when a Web address (URL) is typed into a browser, DNS servers return the IP address of the Web server associated with that name.
                <br> In this made-up example, the DNS converts the URL www.company.com into the IP address 204.0.8.51. Without DNS, you would have to type the series of four numbers and dots into your browser to retrieve the website, which you actually can do

                <h2>Packets (TCP/UDP)</h2>
                 <p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) widely known as Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of communications protocols used over the internet for delivery of services or packets within or across the network. It is commonly known as internet protocol suite.
                <br>
                User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless transport layer communication protocol used to establish low tolerating and loss latency connections for delivery of services or packets within or across the network. It is coupled with an internet protocol suite as an alternative to TCP/IP protocol. https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vdc8TCESIg8UDP constructs a datagram packet and addresses it with a port number of IP appended with data packets and optional checksum capability to verify receipt of intact data arrival. Since UDP protocol is simple protocol, the retransmissions of packets can be decided at senderâ€™s end whether to trade low latency for high reliability over data transmission. UDP reduces overall network traffic owing to network broadcasts feature which broadcasts packets to some computers on the same network and eliminates the need for duplication across the network. As UDP is connectionless protocol, the delivery or order of the data content packets varies.

            <h2>HTTP</h2>
            <p> HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient,
            <br>
            usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more

            <h2>HTML </h2>
            <p> The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            <br>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document

            <h2>Routers</h2>
            <p> A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.
            <br>
            There are several types of routers, but most routers pass data between LANs (local area networks) and WANs (wide area networks). A LAN is a group of connected devices restricted to a specific geographic area. A LAN usually requires a single router.
